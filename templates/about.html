					<h2> About Us </h2>
					<p> Welcome to START-UP SEARCH! </p>
					<h3> Our Aim </h3>
					<p> Our aim is to show students and graduates alternatives to the typical graduate schemes. (not that we anything against them, it's just important to know your options!) </p>
					<h3> Finding a Career </h3>
					<p> We are interested in helping you find a CAREER that you love and are passionate about. Whether this means finding you a company because you have known what you wanted to do since you were 5. Or finding ideas to inspire you on a career path you never dreamed of. We think we can help!</p>
					<h3> Stealing Advice From Dating Sites </h3>
					<blockquote>
				  	<p>
					"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle."
					</p>
					<footer> -Steve Jobs</footer>
					</blockquote>
					<p> We love this quote from Steve Jobs. We think that a truely great career (like a truely great romance) IS infact a matter of the heart. </p>
					<p> Working from this principle, we think we can apply some of the logic from successful dating searches to successful career searches. </p>
					<h3> People are Unique </h3>
					<p> We also understand that, because everyone is different, not everyone will want to find a job in exactly the same way.</p>
					<p> A lot of people have something specifc in mind when career hunting (whether it's a skill they really want to use, or an atomsphere they want to work in).</p>
					<p> For these people, we offer various algorithmic matching. These include location, company size, skills (ones you have or ones you want), type of company or you can allow our mathematicians to work their magic. </p>
					<p> Other people don't have any idea what they want to do. They simply want to learn about new, exciting companies and be inspired.</p>
					<p> For these people, we offer a serendipity approach to the search. We show you a range of companies, with various job openings, and you respond on gut insight (with a flick to the left or to the right). You just log in and let us do the rest to inspire you! </p>
					<h3> Have fun! </h3>
					<p> Unfortunately we cannot guarantee to find your dream career with your dream company, ultimately that is unlikely to happen without a lot of work! We want to show you the possibilities that exist and offer some advice on how (if you are currently unsuitable) to get there! </p>
